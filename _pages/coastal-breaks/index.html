intro: Dream of powder white sand and azure waters… The quintessential holiday image, there’s a reason we all yearn for the beach. While away the hours in the sun, dip in the clear waters, and let the daily grind melt away...
top-pick:
  title: French Riviera
  description: The Côte d'Azur is a bonafide celebrity on the shores of the Mediterranean. Glitz and glamour are oft-used bywords for this stunning stretch of coastline, epitomised in places like St Tropez, Cannes, Monte Carlos and Nice. Away from the opulence and socialite strutting are lesser-known gems like Èze, the idyllic hilltop medieval town that begs to be photographed. With the Mediterranean serving as an irresistible backdrop, the French Riviera warrants exploring, with plenty of beach hopping and opulent nights to be had.
