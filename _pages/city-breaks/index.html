top-pick:
  title: Marrakech
  description: A beguiling destination that turns the city break on its head. Mesmerizing souks come alive in a flurry of technicolour and spice, overloading the senses and creating a heady atmosphere that quickly becomes addictive. Bright riads and medieval alleys offer up a labyrinthine network of endlessly charming scenes. Lush gardens oppose enchanting deserts and inspired Islamic architecture typifies the irresistible beauty of this ancient city.
